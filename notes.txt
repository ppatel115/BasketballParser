player names could be the same between teams, so need both first and last names or other solution
some players have longer names which throws off the parsing,  (ex. Jacob Evans III) gonna include code for 3 part name, but thats the limit
  are three name player recorded in lineup with all three names or just two - do we need to record the third name
does each team have a finite number of lineups (can they be defined beforehand)
  if they do, can create lineup files that we feed into the parser, one for each Team
    lineup would need to include relevant stats like player names, number of bigs, maybe classification of lineup, etc.
do you want to keep lineup stats, or player and lineup stats for each lineup?
  player stats per lineup might be pretty hard, total lineup stats would probably be all you need to analyze lineup performance
  per lineup stats are easier to maintain, just keep running totals for each lineup type

Weird parsing lines:
- dunks
- official timeout, team and TV

Home team score is 2nd number in text, Away Team is first. Check for who's home in neutral sites
Need to handle player names ending with period at the end of sentence


TODO: Add a BigChecker (add a place to count number of bigs in lineups), add a StartingLineup handler, and fix lineups/matchups so that it fits the new stuff
